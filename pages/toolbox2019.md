Some developers actually list the tools they use. I decided to do that too. This page will be the list of my currently used tools.

Perhaps, when you read it, you'd want to suggest me a solution that is better than the one I listed. Feel free to mail me at [klimek.mariusz@gmail.com](klimek.mariusz@gmail.com). I'm always open for suggestions.

## Mindset

Everything (YouTube watch list, Todo List, not archived mails) is a todo list. If it's there, it is not done. If it would be done, it would be in the Second Brain and not on the list.

## Taking notes

* For the purpose of taking note as a process I'm using the [reMarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/) tablet. It is by far my most treasured gadget! Writing manually is suppose to raise the concentration levels (quotation needed) and I always created temporary ToDo lists on paper. As I did with fast notes. The supremacy of reMarkable is that it can actually read my notes, convert them to text and send them to my e-mail. Result? **I'm writing even more manually!**
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - My Second Brain! I keep my notes on Dropbox as Markdown files I access using Obsidian. This application is so good it actually replaced Dynalist :-) And OneNote. No more Pocket Archive, no more tags in Feedly, no more YouTube videos saved for later. Make notes and store them in an Obsidian Vault!

## Planning

* [Microsoft ToDo](https://to-do.microsoft.com/) - I use this for tasks and planning.

## Coding

* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/vs/) - for .NET projects, for corporate work I use this one. Since I decided to never work in PHP and not touch JavaScript (I'm going ablaze with Blazor) I'm using VS even more often.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I do this blog in it. But other than that, I think I only modify Terraform in it. I still like it for everything not .net
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.3.html) - previewing files, editing configurations, simple text editing. So many uses :-)

## Graphics

* [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) - simple, free and full of useful features. Good enough for a graphics noob like me.

## Other

* [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - lightweight PDF reader. That remembers where I finished (very important feature).
* [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org) - for zips, obviously.
* [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/) - whenever I need an office I use this. Which occurs hardly ever these days.

## Tool refinement

* [Alternativeto.net](http://alternativeto.net) - probably the most important. I use it for tool refinement. I tend to treat my solutions as fixed. Sometimes I dare to check whether it will point to some kind of new tool that can replace the old one. And sometimes it does. It replaced Workflowy with Dynalist, for example.
