# Last update 31.01.2019

Some developers actually list the tools they use. I decided to do that too. This page will be the list of my currently used tools.

Perhaps, when you read it, you'd want to suggest me a solution that is better than the one I listed. Feel free to mail me at [klimek.mariusz@gmail.com](klimek.mariusz@gmail.com). I'm always open for suggestions.

## Taking notes

* [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) - so far it's the best way to note structured information. As I learned this way of thinking resonates strongly with me, therefore I try to use it in every way possible.
* [OneNote](https://products.office.com/pl-pl/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) - I should probably consider it a legacy application and move every note to Dynalist. But there's just to much of this for now.

## Planning

* [Microsoft ToDo](https://to-do.microsoft.com/) - my planner. As I use Dynalist for notes, I use this for tasks and planning. Everything not SMART enough goes to Dynalist, or at least that's the idea.

## Coding

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my favorite code editor. I do this blog in it. If the project isn't a big .NET solution that requires solution management - I use VS Code. I made PHP in it, JavaScript, node.js, all sort of web projects. Best IDE ever.
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/vs/) - for .NET projects, for corporate work I use this one.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.3.html) - previewing files, editing configurations, simple text editing. So many uses :-)
* [Git Extensions](https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git_extensions.html) - since I'm not a bash master and I lack the will to do everything from bash command line I decided to use a GUI for Git. I tried few solutions and consider Git Extensions to be the one best suited for me. Simple, seems close to bash and free.

## Graphics

* [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/) - simple, free and full of useful features. Good enough for a graphics noob like me.

## Other

* [Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) - lightweight PDF reader. That remembers where I finished (very important feature).
* [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org) - for zips, obviously.
* [WPS Office](https://www.wps.com/) - whenever I need an office I use this.
* [Alternativeto.net](http://alternativeto.net) - probably the most important. I use it for tool refinement. I tend to treat my solutions as fixed. Sometimes I dare to check whether it will point to some kind of new tool that can replace the old one. And sometimes it does. It replaced Workflowy with Dynalist, for example.
