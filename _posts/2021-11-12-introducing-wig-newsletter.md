# I decided to start a newsletter!

I set up a Revue account and started ~~blogging~~ emailing about becoming a game developer. Not that I have any experience in that matter (as of 2021-11-12), but I'm going to document it. Or die trying.

I decided too write about learning about tools and productivity also, as I treat those two as Act 1 and Act 2 of a Game Developer Career (not that I have any expierience in saying so), but if creating games is Act 3, then as you probably know - **if you're act 3 sucks, the problem lies in act 1 and 2** ;-)
