I used to have a Wordpress blog. I wasn't happy with it. It was PHP, I made some sites in PHP and I did not like them. When I saw Wordpress' code I was thinking is it worth to learn it? I was unable to prepare a theme for myself, the amount of plugins was overwhelming and the amount of emails I got about plugin updates were just frustrating. Not only that, I was buying this PHP hosting (because almost every hosting in Poland is all about PHP) with a domain, and the truth is - I rarely updated my blog. I still have trouble with self discipline to write a blog post. And I paid for it annualy.

And then a friend of mine showed me GitHub Pages and his blog made in Jekyll. I looked at it, and I fell in love. I knew that this is the next step for me. Away from PHP I can learn new skills and technologies and deploy them for free.

So the obvious question is: what next?

Well...

1. I will migrate some of my old blogs from Wordpress to Jekyll. Not much, as I will grant oblivion to old PHP posts.

2. I will learn Jekyll and develop my own theme for the blog.

3. I will document my developer journey in several fields, with the following as probable goals in the near future:

   * Electron applications

   * Game Maker games

   * Godot engine games perhaps?

   * .NET Core in any form possible

4. I'm also preparing some articles, not sure if as blog posts or not, things that will land on the menu, because there'are just so good :-)

Well then... Warp speed, I guess?
