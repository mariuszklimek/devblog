"There's no path before me, and a track will be created behind me." - Takamura Kotaro, Japanese poet.

Hi there.

You won't find any coaching here, nor articles about soft skills in a developer's life, nor any thinking about oxygen and other stuff like that. This blog exists mostly to document my coding achievements, experience, steps and milestones. Sometimes I may write a tutorial on something. Or link some of my external projects. But basically it's a supplement to my CV. I leave non technical stuff to other devs, for now. I want to share my experience hoping you will find answers to a question you're having. Or that I can help you in any way.

My name is Mariusz Klimek. I'm a .NET Developer usually making web applications. I used to make hobby webpages with PHP, but decided to pursue a new path. As every young developer I dream about many things. Mastering skills, creating products that change something, making computer games.
