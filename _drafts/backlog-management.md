We all have at least one. A backlog, a todo list, a pile of shame, call it however you want. But you have at least one! I know I have. Not one, not two, but much more.

What am I talking about?
- you create dedicated topic-oriented lists for YouTube videos for future use
- you use the Pocket archive for already read articles
- you tag articles in Feedly 
- you have bookmarks in your browser, because you lie to yourself their content will be useful someday
- not to mention all those highlights in ebooks read on your Kindle
- you keep some old newsletter with useful info, because... well, you think they'll become useful.

And you never return to them. If you do, then you are a better man than I am. Because this is a problem I'm trying to solve right now, and I will tell you how I do it.

# The problem
- If only there was a way to query all those archives at once, to get the information I need, when I need it...
- If only there was a way to have only the essence of those articles, minus the ads, intros, not needed opinion and so on...
- If only it was fairly cheap, like... free of charge, for example...

# The solution
David Allen (I think) once said that "Your brain is for thinking, not for remembering". And all these backlogs, altough they remember 

# Enter Obsidian
