We all have at least one. A backlog, a todo list, a pile of shame, call it however you want. But you have at least one! I know I have. Not one, not two, but much more.

What am I talking about exactly?
- you create dedicated topic-oriented lists for YouTube videos for future use
- you archive already read articles in Pocket
- you tag articles in Feedly 
- you have bookmarks in your browser, because you lie to yourself their content will be useful someday
- not to mention all those highlights and notes you make in ebooks on your Kindle
- you archived some old newsletter with useful info in Gmail, because... well, you think they'll become useful.

And you never return to them. How many times when searching for an answer to a problem you consult your backlogs? If you do, then you are a better man than I am. Because this is a problem I'm trying to solve right now, and I will tell you how I do it.

# The problem
- If only there was a way to query all those archives at once, to get the information I need, when I need it...
- If only there was a way to have only the essence of those articles, minus the ads, intros, not needed opinion and so on...
- If only it was fairly cheap, like... free of charge, for example...

# The solution - take notes... you're welcome ;-)
David Allen (or so I think) once said that "Your brain is for thinking, not for remembering". And although you have all those backlogs, you still have to remember them. Some time ago, when trying to refine my productivity, I encountered the term "Second Brain".

# Enter Obsidian
So I learnt about this thing called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and instantly knew it will be useful for me. The main premise of it is that it's  A lot of work is before me, but the benefits are worth the effort. 

# Enter Dropbox
I don't use the paid version of Obsidian (yet), so in order to make use of some good old sync I'm using [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com). Also free version (currently no need for more).
